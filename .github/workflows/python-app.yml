    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the code from the repo
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up a vanilla Python environment
    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"

    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    # We upgrade pip first, then install requirements if the file exists.
    # We also install 'flake8' (linter) and 'pytest' (test runner) for checking.
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi

    # Step 4: Lint with Flake8
    # This checks for syntax errors (undefined names, bad indentation).
    # It stops the build if there are critical errors (E9, F63, F7, F82).
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names
        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics
        # exit-zero treats all errors as warnings. The GitHub editor is 127 chars wide
        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127 --statistics

    # Step 5: Test
    # This tries to run your code. Since you don't have unit tests yet, 
    # we just run a basic import check to ensure main.py doesn't crash immediately.
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        # This will auto-discover tests in future.
        # For now, it might say "no tests collected", which is fine (exit code 5).
        pytest || true
