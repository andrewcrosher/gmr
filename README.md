Baseline race calendar and scoring
Basic driver & constructor roster
Rudimentary car inherited from player’s father
Money drains weekly from garage upkeep
Simple race simulation with reliability/skill variance

Solid skeleton. Playable end-to-end loop, but everything relied on magic values and placeholders.

v0.4 — Systems Stabilised & Reality Added

Gameplay logic tightened, economy stops lying
